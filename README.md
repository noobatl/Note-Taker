## DESCRIPTION
 
As a user, I want to be able to write, save and delete notes, so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete. 
To keep track of my notes. 
I do not have to rely on cloud based note takers, I can use my local machine if I want. 
I learned how to set up a server in Heroku and how to connect routes to server.js. 
This project stands out because it can be used as a starting tool to make and design your own note taker.
